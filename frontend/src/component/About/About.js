        <p>Hello everyone! I am Sanskar Adhikari and this is my senior project</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>As a college student, I have personally experienced the challenges of finding affordable ways to buy and sell items, as well as the difficulties of trying to give away items that are no longer needed. This inspired me to create a platform that addresses these issues and provides a space for students to easily and safely buy, sell, and give away items to their peers. My senior project is a reflection of my passion for solving problems and my desire to create something that will make a positive impact on my community. I am excited to see this project come to fruition and to provide a valuable resource for college students like myself.</p>
